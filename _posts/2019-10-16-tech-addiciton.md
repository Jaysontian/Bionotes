>The first organisms to inhabit Earth were prokaryotes that lived 3.5 bilion years ago.

### Prokaryotic Structure

- Most prokaryotes are unicellular and are much smaller than eukaryotic cells.
- The **Cell Wall** retains cell shape, protection, and prevents it from bursting in a hypotonic environment. 
	- In eukaryotes like plants and fungi usualy have cell walls made of cellulose or chitin. Bacterial cells contain cell walls made of **peptidoglycan**, which are made by modified sugars and polypeptides.
	- Archaeal cell walls contain proteins and polysaccharides but **lack peptidoglycan**.
